	<h1>How it works</h1>
	
	<p>Here's a Hand makes it easier for family and friends to offer a hand.</p>

	<p>Family and friends can set up an online group to quickly and easily send 
		messages by mobile phone text and email.  </p>

	<p>Each person can decide what they want to offer, and when and how they'd like 
		to be contacted. </P> 
	
	<p>So people will only receive a message if the request matches 
		what they have offered. </p>
